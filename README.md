# kmeans-clustering
Problem # 1 - Clustering
=========================
1. You will be provided a user dataset (filename hyderabad-salaried-employees.csv) on which clustering needs to be performed
2. Perform EDA (exploratory data analysis) on this dataset and any plots which could be meaningful should be included in the jupyter notebooks
3. Apply machine learning models (simpler models will be preferred if performance of simple models is almost similar to complex models e.g. deep neural network models) and perform clustering
4. Graphs showing clusters need to be provided
5. There is no pre-determined number of clusters. The proper number of clusters need to be found and reason behind that should be mentioned
6. The output should be in the form of an excel file with one sheet for each cluster and all the users for the corresponding to each cluster in that sheet
7. Feel free to include/exclude the columns in the dataset based on their perceived importance and mention why they were included/excluded
